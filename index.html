            <h1>Economy of the Baltic States</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Baltic States Economy Visualizer using ESRI JavaScript SDK and ChartJS.</p>
            <p class="header-text">
                The Baltic countries - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - share common features and a similar history.
                These three countries at the EU border with Russia regained their independence from the Soviet Union
                in the early nineties before joining the EU in 2004 and more recently, the euro area. They display
                major similarities in terms of their geography, size, economic structure, development and
                demography; but also some differences, particularly with respect to Estonia, which is often considered
                ahead of its peers in some ways.
                <strong>To start, click on two baltic countries of your choice.</strong> A graph
                for GDP/capita and a time series for Residential Property Prices will be automatically displayed on the
                right. <strong>Tap anywhere else on the map to clear your selection.</strong>

                        <p>GDP per capita is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output, divided by mid-year population. Growth is calculated from constant price GDP data in local currency. Sustained economic growth increases average incomes and is strongly linked to poverty reduction. GDP per capita provides a basic measure of the value of output per person, which is an indirect indicator of per capita income. Growth in GDP and GDP per capita are considered broad measures of economic growth.</p>

                        Residential Property Prices Indices (RPPIs) â€“ also named House price indices (HPIs), are index numbers
                        that measure the prices of residential properties over time. RPPIs are key statistics not only for
                        citizens and households across the world, but also for economic and monetary policy makers. They can
                        help, for example, to monitor potential macroeconomic imbalances and the risk exposure of the household
                        and financial sectors.</p>
